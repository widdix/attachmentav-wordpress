## Development

To clear the database, run:

```
docker compose down --volumes
```

Use the following command to spin up a development environment.

```
docker compose up
```

To make email work:

```
docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                  COMMAND  
93b4f65875ae   wordpress:latest       "docker-entrypoint.sâ€¦"   6 hours ago   Up 6 hours   0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp                  attachmentav-wordpress-wordpress-1

docker exec -it 93b4f65875ae /bin/bash

apt-get update && apt-get install -y sendmail && apt-get clean
/usr/sbin/sendmail -bd
```

Optionally use `ngrok` to get a publicly reachable development domain.

```
ngrok http http://localhost:80
```

> You might need to set the `siteurl` an `home` option in [phpMyAdmin](http://localhost:8081/index.php?route=/sql&pos=0&db=wordpress&table=wp_options) to `http://localhost` or the ngrok URL if this changed since last time.

Inside PHP, use `error_log('log line');` or `error_log(print_r($var, true));` to print debug logs.
